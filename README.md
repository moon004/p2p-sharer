# Peer-to-peer file sharing system

P2P Sharer is a peer to peer file sharing system that is built on top of IPFS protocol which allows you to directly send your local file to other machine without having to rely on any third party organization like Dropbox and so on.

More than that, it also enables you to add your friend by linking your peers' ipfs ID with the naming you set.
